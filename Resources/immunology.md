# Overview
I know very little about immunology, so just learning stuff and writing things I learn / need to remember as I go.

* Lymphocyes include T and B cells, NK cells other?
* Myeloid cells
* Red blood cells

# Cell types

## Monocytes
* CD14 positive (and negative CD16) monocytes are also called classical monocytes (MonoC): CD14++CD16--
* CD16 positive (and negative CD14) monocytes are also called non-classical monocytes (MonoNC): CD16++CD14--
* Intermediate monocytes have high levels of CD14 and low (but positive) levels of CD16: CD14++CD16+

## T cells

### CD4

these include Tregs?

### CD8

### Other T cells

## B cells
* Naive
* Memory

# Markers

* Myeloid: CD33+
