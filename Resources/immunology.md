I know very little about immunology, so just learning stuff and writing things I learn / need to remember as I go.

## Cell types

### Monocytes
* CD14 positive (and negative CD16) monocytes are also called classical monocytes (MonoC): CD14++CD16--
* CD16 positive (and negative CD14) monocytes are also called non-classical monocytes (MonoNC): CD16++CD14--
* Intermediate monocytes have high levels of CD14 and low (but positive) levels of CD16: CD14++CD16+
