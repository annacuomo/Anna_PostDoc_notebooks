## CpG transitions 

CpG transitions refers to mutations at `CG' sequences, which generally happen when a methylated C gets mutated to a T. 
As a result, the mutation rate depends on the rate of methylation at that site, which varies a lot across the genome. 
These are by far the most mutable positions in the genome.
