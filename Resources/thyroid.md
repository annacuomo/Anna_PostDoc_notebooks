# Thyroid biology

## Thyroid basics

Thyroid follicular cells (also called thyroid epithelial cells or thyrocytes) are the major cell type in the thyroid gland, and are responsible for the production and secretion of the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).

## Thyroid diseases

* hyperthyroidism: overactive tyroid
  * can lead to Graves' disease (autoimmune)
* hypothyroidism: underactive thyroid
  * can be caused to Hashimoto's disease (also autoimmune)
* thryoid non-cancerous tumours
* thyroid cancer
* pregnancy-linked thryoid issues    

## Genetics

### GWAS for Graves' disease (GD), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) & maybe other?
