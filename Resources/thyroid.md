# Thyroid biology

## Thyroid basics (wiki)

The thyroid, or thyroid gland, is an endocrine gland in vertebrates. 
In humans, it is in the neck and consists of two connected lobes. 
The lower two thirds of the lobes are connected by a thin band of tissue called the isthmus. 
The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck below the Adam's apple.

Microscopically, the functional unit of the thyroid gland is the spherical thyroid follicle, lined with follicular cells (thyrocytes), and occasional parafollicular cells that surround a lumen containing colloid. 
The thyroid gland secretes three hormones: the two thyroid hormones – triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) – and a peptide hormone, calcitonin. 

The thyroid hormones influence the metabolic rate and protein synthesis and growth and development in children. 
Calcitonin plays a role in calcium homeostasis.
Secretion of the two thyroid hormones is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is secreted from the anterior pituitary gland.
TSH is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which is produced by the hypothalamus.


## Thyroid diseases

* hyperthyroidism: overactive tyroid
  * can lead to Graves' disease (autoimmune)
* hypothyroidism: underactive thyroid
  * can be caused to Hashimoto's disease (also autoimmune)
  * iodine-deficiency, more common in isolated & mountaneous regions, linked to intellectual disability
* thryoid non-cancerous tumours / lumps
* thyroid cancer
* pregnancy-linked thryoid issues
