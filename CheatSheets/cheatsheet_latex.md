## Useful Commands LateX edition
(Adding here useful LateX commands I find myself forgetting and having to routinely google.)

Mostly, I figured these out when compiling my [PhD thesis](https://github.com/annacuomo/PhD_Thesis/).

* ```\clearpage``` instead of ```\newpage```, when figures and tables just move around and don't stay where you put them, this is a good way to enforce an order ([for example, to enforce the caption of Fig S2 to go after the figure](https://github.com/annacuomo/CellRegMap_Supplementary_Methods/blob/main/supplementary_figures.tex)).
* ```\textcolor{blue}{text_i_need_in_colour}``` to colour one piece of text (_e.g._, minor revisions for my thesis)
* in formulae, ```\in``` is the "belongs to" symbol
* to capitalise greek letters, use ```\boldsymbol{\theta}```
* in formulae, ```sim``` is ~ (distributed as)
* ```\underbrace_{y}_{sc. \ expr}``` adds an bracket under ```y``` to specify it represents single-cell expression
