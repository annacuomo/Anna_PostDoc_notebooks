## Current personal website

Currently, personal website is hosted at https://annacuomo.github.io, code [here](https://github.com/annacuomo/annacuomo.github.io).

### To modify content:

* [Publications](https://github.com/annacuomo/annacuomo.github.io/tree/main/_publications) as separate .md files, one per paper.
* [Talks](https://github.com/annacuomo/annacuomo.github.io/tree/main/_talks) as separate .md files.
* [About](https://github.com/annacuomo/annacuomo.github.io/blob/main/_pages/about.md) - Overview page.
* [CV](https://github.com/annacuomo/annacuomo.github.io/blob/main/_pages/cv.md): Education, Work Experience, Publications (linked directly from the publication page).
* [Files](https://github.com/annacuomo/annacuomo.github.io/tree/main/files) - at the moment, PDFs for each paper.
* [Profile Pic](https://github.com/annacuomo/annacuomo.github.io/blob/main/images/profile.png) - goes to the top left corner.
* [Config file](https://github.com/annacuomo/annacuomo.github.io/blob/main/_config.yml). Many things can be changed here and I have not fully worked this out yet. For now I have modified what goes on the left of the webpage, links and titles and short bio (that I can remember).
* [Navigation file](https://github.com/annacuomo/annacuomo.github.io/blob/main/_data/navigation.yml) to add which pages should be visible (I think).

Many more things are customizable presubmably, but this is what I have changed so far compared to the [template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

### To change the style:

To see what things would look like / how everything is encoded, hover over some part of the website, right-click and select inspect.
To overwrite defaults and change thins permanently, add to [this file](https://github.com/annacuomo/annacuomo.github.io/blob/main/assets/css/main.scss) using a syntax like in this example:

```
.archive__item-title {
    font-size: 1em;
}
```
