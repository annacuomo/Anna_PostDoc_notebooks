## RNA-seq

### Sequencing files: FASTQ

Stores the nucleotide sequence plus information on the sequencing quality

### Alignment files: SAM/BAM/CRAM

SAM: tab-delimited text format to store genomic alignment: header (@) + alignment sections

## Genotypes

VCF (variant call format) is the standard file format for storing variation data.
Each row represents a locus, with columns representing info on that locus and then genotypes at that locus for one or more individuals (one column per individual).
