## Inspect info re: image

```bash
singularity inspect -d SAIGE-QTL.sif
```

shows you the code part of the recipe / definition file used to build the image.


Usage specifically for GCP at [this link](https://github.com/annacuomo/Garvan_useful_commands/blob/main/Garvan_HPC/Setting_up_singularity.md), note that this is a private repo atm.
