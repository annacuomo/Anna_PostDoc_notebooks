## Hail Batch

Hail batch is a python-based workflow language, similar to WDL or Snakemake, but with easy use of Hail Query inside.

My main experience with this is so far is an end-to-end [workflow](https://github.com/populationgenomics/cellregmap-pipeline/blob/main/batch.py), from selecting rare variants to running association tests.

### Common commands I always forget

### Other

In the future, I may want to adapt [Konrad K's SAIGE on UKBB exmples workflow](https://github.com/Nealelab/ukb_exomes) to running the new Poisson version of SAIGE on scRNA-seq + WGS data from TenK10K.
