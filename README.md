# Anna PostDoc miscellaneous

Various from postdoc projects at Garvan (Sydney) in [Joseph Powell](https://www.garvan.org.au/about-us/people/jospow) and [Daniel MacArthur](https://www.garvan.org.au/about-us/people/danmac) labs (2022-present).

* [CheatSheets](CheatSheets/) are collections of syntax / best practices etc that I routinely forget
* [Resources](Resources/) are collections of useful papers / blog posts / tools and other resources I want easy access to
* The [CellRegMap](CellRegMap/) folder should potentially be moved elsewhere, at the moment it contains [CellRegMap](https://limix.github.io/CellRegMap/)-related work that is not applied to the TenK10K phase 1 dataset ([repo](https://github.com/annacuomo/TenK10K_analyses_HPC)) nor integral part of the [method](https://github.com/limix/CellRegMap) nor the [pipeline](https://github.com/populationgenomics/cellregmap-pipeline)
